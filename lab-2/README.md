The purpose of lab 1 is to 
  * Introduce the basic concepts of programming: 
    * lists
    * functions
  
Workshop content:
  * Rock, paper, sissors: introduce the game
  * 

**Homework: weather prediction game**

Game Rules:
The game should have a list of at least 5 different weather conditions (e.g., Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Windy, Snowy).

At the start of each round:
* The game randomly selects one of these conditions as the actual weather.
* The player is asked to predict what the weather will be.
* After the player makes their prediction:

  * The game reveals the actual weather.
  * Points are awarded as follows:
    3 points for a correct prediction
    1 point for a "close" prediction (you decide what counts as close)
    0 points for an incorrect prediction

* The game should run for multiple rounds (you decide how many).
* At the end of all rounds, the game should display the player's total score.

Your Implementation Should Include:
* A function to get the player's prediction.
* A function to generate the actual weather.
* A function to calculate the score for each round.
* A main game loop that runs for the specified number of rounds.
* Clear instructions and feedback for the player throughout the game.

Bonus Features (Optional):
* Allow the player to choose how many rounds they want to play.
* Implement a "weather streak" bonus for consecutive correct predictions.
* Create a "weather report" at the end, showing how often each condition occurred.
* Add difficulty levels that change the number of weather conditions or scoring system.
