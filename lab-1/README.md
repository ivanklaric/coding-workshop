The purpose of lab 1 is to 
  * Lay out what we expect to build in this workshop
  * Set up the tools and show main flows
  * Introduce the basic concepts of programming: 
    * variables & types
    * if statements and basic boolean logic
    * loops
  
Workshop content:
  * Set up the environment: install the tools, build & run hello world  
        [Instructions to follow](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)
  * Hello, world
  * Hello, {name}
  * Number guessing game
    1. print a random number
    2. one attempt version
    3. introduce hints
    4. keep using until you get it
  * introduce the debugger in each step, follow variables' content
  * make the number range [0,100]. How many attempts does it take to guess?

Homework, extra points:
  * Coin-toss game: you're given 3 attempts to guess a coin-toss result. 
    Every time you get it right you score one point. Output total score after 3 attempts.
